GoAPRS
------

GoAPRS is a tool to export Google Latitude personal location data to the APRS
network.

Requirements
------------

Longitude - http://github.com/eharmon/longitude
Python sqlite3
Python argpase
Python telnetlib

How to use
----------

GoAPRS does not fetch data from Google Latitude, that is the job of the
Longitude script. Once Longitude has placed the information in the database,
GoAPRS takes it and submits it to the APRS network, allowing you to update
your APRS location via Google Latitude.

Thus, GoAPRS is not just a Google Latitude to APRS sync, but a program to sync
any location data to APRS, so long as it follows the database format which
Longitude produces.

To set up GoAPRS, first set up Longitude, then choose from the options listed
in the Usage section to configure GoAPRS to your requirements. APRS uses a
hash based authentication scheme, in order to generate your password enter
your amateur radio callsign into the following website:

You may wish to add a similar cron job for GoAPRS as you did for Longitude in
order to automatically keep your information updated. Please note, however,
that you most likely want to update at 5 minute or greater intervals, so as to
avoid abusing the APRS network.
